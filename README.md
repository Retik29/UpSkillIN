## 🔔 Remember
This is a demo/clone project of the Skill India website. It uses PHP, HTML, Tailwind (CSS), and JavaScript. During the live demo through GitHub, PHP won't render. For better understanding, use code editors that support PHP and make changes, like in the file `phpmailer.php`. You will also need to create a local database.
